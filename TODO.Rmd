# TODO		
		
**(x)** is used for tasks that are completed.  **(WIP)** is used for
tasks that are in progress.
		
		
## Checks

- **(x)** Check that the dimensions/the content of the data given as
  inputs for the `predict` and the `simulate` methods are consistent
  with the content of the object used to predict or simulate from.
		
## `summary` methods

- **(x)** Add a `summary` method for the class `"fgpm"`.

- **(x)** Add a `summary` method for the class `"Xfgpm"`.

## `plot` methods

- **(x)** Add a `plot` method for the class `"fgpm"`.

- **(x)** Add a `plot` method for the class `"Xfgpm"`.

- **(x)** For the plot methods that produce two plots on a same graphic, add
  an extra argument `horiz` to allow the user to chose the the way in
  which the plots are set. This will be useful for reports or articles
  such as the JSS.
  
- Add an `horiz` argument in the `plot`method for the S3 class
  `"predict.fgpm"`and in the  `plotPred` method/function.

- Add `autoplot` methods allowing to get **ggplot2* graphics.

## Class `"Xfgpm"`

- Store a copy of `sIn` and `sOut` as two new slots of the class.
  This will help at recreating any `fgpm` model visited from the data
  used in the fit. Maybe write a new function for that aim? How to
  specify the model to be re-created: by its number?

- Improve the `summary` method. Should work correctly even when there 
  are many inputs. Maybe add options to provide details on the scalar 
  and the functional inputs separately in order to avoid having a table
  which is too wide.

## S3 classes `"predict.fgpm"` and `"simulate.fgpm"`

- **(x)** Set the S3 class ot the output of the `predict` and
  `simulate` methods to `"predict.fgpm"` and `"simulate.fgpm"` both
  inheriting from `"list"`. This allows to write (S3) plot methods
  without breaking the inherited standard behaviours (in `print`,
  ...).

## Simplifications

- Should we still export the methods `plotSims`, `plotPred`.

- Rename the formal arguments of the `predict` and `simulate` methods
  for the class `"fgpm"` to use the same formal names? Could be for
  instance `sIn.new` and `fIn.new` or even simply `sIn`and `fIn`.

## Tests

- Add tests to make sure that the checks on the size of objects
  actually do what we expect.

## NEWS

Try

```{r}
library(funGp)
example(plot.predict.fgpm)
example(plt.simulate.fgpm)
```
