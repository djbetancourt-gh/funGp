# TODO		
		
## Checks

- **(x)** Check that the dimensions/the content of the data given as
  inputs for the `predict` and the `simulate` methods are consistent
  with the content of the object used to predict or simulate from.
		
## `summary` methods

- **(x)** Add a `summary` method for the class `"fgpm"`.

- **(x)** Add a `summary` method for the class `"Xfgpm"`.

## `plot` methods

- **(x)** Add a `plot` method for the class `"fgpm"`.

- **(x)** Add a `plot` method for the class `"Xfgpm"`.

- For the plot methods that produce two plots on a same graphic, add
  an extra argument `horiz` to allow the user to chose the the way in
  which the plots are set. This will be useful for reports or articles
  such as the JSS.

- Add `autoplot` methods allowing to get **ggplot2* graphics.

## Class `"Xfgpm"`

- Store a copy of `sIn` and `sOut` as two new slots of the class.
  This will help at recreating any `fgpm` model visited from the data
  used in the fit. Maybe write a new function for that aim? How to
  specify the model to be re-created: by its number?

- Improve the `summary` method. Should work correctly even when there 
  are many inputs. Maybe add options to provide details on the scalar 
  and the functional inputs separately in order to avoid having a table
  which is too wide.

## S3 classes `"predict.fgpm"` and `"simulate.fgpm"`

- Set the S3 class ot the output of the `predict` and `simulate`
  methods to `"predict.fgpm"` and `"simulate.fgpm"` both inheriting
  from `"list"`. This allows to write (S3) plot methods without
  breaking the inherited standard behaviours (in `print`, ...).
