\title{Matern 5/2 correlation function}
\usage{
matern52_cor2(Ms, thetas)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ms}{a list with as many elements as inputs. Each element of the list must be a n times n matrix of differences
between the observation coordinates, with n the number of input coordinates.}

\item{thetas}{an array with the length-scale parameters corresponding to the inputs for which the distance matrices were provided.}
}
\value{
A correlation matrix of dimension n times n computed from the Matern 5/2 correlation function.
}
\description{
Applies the Matern 5/2 correlation function to a list of distance matrices using corresponding length-scale parameters.
