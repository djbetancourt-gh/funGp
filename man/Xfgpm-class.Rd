\title{S4 class for funGp model selection data structures}
\description{
This is the formal representation of the assembly of data structures delivered by the model
selection routines in the \link[=funGp-package]{funGp package}. Gaussian process models are useful
statistical tools in the modeling of complex input-output relationships. An Xfgpm object contains the
trace of an optimization process, conducted to build Gaussian process models of outstanding performance.
