\usage{
\S4method{simulate}{fgpm}(
  object,
  nsim = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  sIn.sm = NULL,
  fIn.sm = NULL,
  nugget.sm = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \linkS4class{fgpm} corresponding to the funGp model from which
simulations must be performed.}

\item{nsim}{An optional integer indicating the number of samples to produce. Default is 1.}

\item{seed}{An optional value interpreted as an integer, that will be used as argument of
\code{\link[base]{set.seed}} just before simulating the response values.}

\item{sIn.sm}{An optional matrix of scalar input coordinates at which the output values should be
simulated. Each column is interpreted as a scalar input variable and each row as a coordinate.
Either scalar input coordinates (sIn.sm), functional input coordinates (fIn.sm), or both must be provided.}

\item{fIn.sm}{An optional list of functional input coordinates at which the output values should be
simulated. Each element of the list is interpreted as a functional input variable. Every functional input
variable should be provided as a matrix with one curve per row. Either scalar input coordinates (sIn.sm),
functional input coordinates (fIn.sm), or both must be provided.}

\item{nugget.sm}{An optional number corresponding to a numerical nugget effect. If provided, this number
is added to the main diagonal of the simulation covariance matrix in order to prevent numerical
instabilities during Cholesky decomposition. A small number in the order of 1e-8 is often enough.
Default is 0.}

\item{detail}{An optional character string specifying the extent of information that should be delivered
by the method, to be chosen between "light" and "full". \emph{Light} simulations produce a matrix of
simulated output values, with as many rows as requested random samples. \emph{Full} simulations produce a
list with the matrix of simulated output values, along with the predicted mean, standard deviation and
limits of the 95\% confidence intervals at the simulation points. Default is "light".}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
An object containing the data structures linked to simulations. For \emph{light} simulations, the
  output will be a matrix of simulated output values, with as many rows as requested random samples.
  For \emph{full} simulations, the output will be a list with the matrix of simulated output values,
  along with the predicted mean, standard deviation and limits of the 95\% confidence intervals at the
  simulation points.
}
\description{
This method enables simulation of Gaussian process values at any given set of points
  based on a pre-built funGp model. Check \code{\link{fgpm}} for information on how to create funGp models.
